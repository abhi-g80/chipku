Paste bin in Golang.

This is an in-memory paste bin which tries to be extremely minimal and doesn't get in the way. Simply a tool to quickly share snippets. No backend databases, no code formatting or code commenting, no self-destructing messages.

If you restart the application, you **will lose** your snippets.
